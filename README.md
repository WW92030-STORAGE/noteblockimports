# noteblockimports
MIDI arrangements of classical music pieces.<br/>

Please note that the MIDIs are to be used solely for NBS (but are written such that they can be logically read as a set of parts/voices), as they are specially designed such that they can be imported directly into NBS (or similar) and be mostly within octave range. As such, I do not recommend trying to use them for other purposes.<br/>

NOTE - The MIDIs are not completely error-free (both in terms of arrangement and in terms of NBS). You might need to change a few notes in NBS yourself, but it is much easier than having to manually change everything from an imported score MIDI (e.g. a piano solo).<br/>
NOTE II - Additionally, most pieces listed here are imported into NBS at x2 or above precision. You must trial and error until it sounds good.<br/>
