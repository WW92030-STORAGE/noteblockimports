MIDI arrangements of classical music pieces.<br/>

Please note that the MIDIs are to be used solely for NBS, as they are specially designed such that they can be imported directly into NBS (or similar) and be mostly within octave range. As such, I do not recommend trying to use them for other purposes.<br/>

NOTE - The MIDIs are not completely error-free. You might need to change a few notes in NBS yourself, but it is much easier than having to manually change everything from an imported score MIDI (e.g. a piano solo).
